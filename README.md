# Keylogger
A program that logs keystrokes and sends them to an email address every 5 minutes. To use this code yourself, you must enter your own sending and receiving email credentials and import the pynput library into your Python interpreter. The email adresses used in the source code are just fakes and the sending email port number used in the source code is for gmail but you can change it to whatever the port number is for the email domain you're using. Save the file with .pyw extnesion to make sure the program runs in the background.
